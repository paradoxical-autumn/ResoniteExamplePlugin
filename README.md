# ResoniteExamplePlugin
A collection of files used for demonstrating Resonite plugins.

This repo is never finished and is managed by [Paradox19](https://wiki.resonite.com/User:Paradox19), someone who understands how to create plugins, but not _why_ certain things are the way they are. You may find comments saying things like "Do this: I don't know why". If you find one and know why, replace the comment!
