# ProtoFlux Bindings
PFX bindings are used to convert a protoflux node into a component, so the FrooxEngine Datamodel can understand it.

Parts of the files are almost exact clones of each other. For a general ruleset of what bindings can basically be identical:
ObjectFunction <---> ValueFunction
Callable nodes <---> Async callable nodes
